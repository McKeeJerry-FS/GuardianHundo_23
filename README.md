This is the first of many JavaScript challenges that will be created throughout the time at Coder Foundry. The idea of this challenge is to get two numbers; a starting number and an ending number from the user. Then when the button is pressed, all numbers will be posted on the page in table format in the range of the starting and ending numbers. The even numbers will also appear in <strong>BOLD</strong>.

This challege was created using three functions:
### getValues

### generateValues

### displayValues
